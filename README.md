a multiplayer platformer

It is an online multiplayer platformer web game where the computer generates a random level and you compete with everyone else to find the platform that is yellow with a green 
outline first. The red squares are other players, the green one is you, arrow keys to move and purple circles are respawn ancors that will set your spawn when you touch them.
Artwork and better platformer physics and many other improvements will be made in the future, it is still early in development.
